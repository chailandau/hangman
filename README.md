# Hangman

## How to begin

Type `node .` into your terminal.

## Gameplay

The goal of the game is to correctly guess the randomly chosen word (selected via word bank) before the guy is hanged. Choose wisely, or his death is on your hands.

You get 6 incorrect guesses before his untimely death. For each correct guess, the game will add the letter where it belongs in the word. Duplicate guesses do not count against you. Your guess must be a letter from A-Z. If you put multiple letters, it will only count your first one as a guess. It will not allow special characters, so don't even try.

If you want to exit the game, you can hit `CTRL + C`
